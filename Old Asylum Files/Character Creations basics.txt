Asylum character creation:

ATTRIBUTES
- All start at 1
- +10 points to distribute
- Max is 5 before purchasing ASPECTS

SKILLS:
- All start at 0
- +7 points to distribute
- Max is 2 ("Expert") before purchasing ASPECTS
- Skills as expert rating gain one free KNACK, record it in the KNACKS section.

ASPECTS:
- Technically, a character's RACE is an Aspect.  So everyone starts out with a free aspect
- +10 points to buy extra aspects
- Humans may only buy from the Human and Common Aspects lists.
- Supernaturals may only buy from the Supernatural and Common Aspects lists

HARMONY:
- Humans start with 6, all others with 5
- CONTRACTS reduce harmony at player and GM's discretion

FOUNDATIONS:
- 1st is most essential, 6th is least
- All Foundations must be filled
- Foundations are keyed to HARMONY, meaning that a Foundation with an empty HARMONY dot next to it is said to be "Threatened"
- There are no system effects for Threatened Foundations, it's simply noted that your character is experiencing a conflict or crisis of that ethic/characteristic.

CONTRACTS:
- Supernatural characters start out with 1 Contract that reduces HARMONY.  This is why all non-humans start out with 1 less HARMONY.
- This initial contract covers how a supernatural character came to be on Earth and/or have a human disguise
- Otherwise, characters may trade up to 5 points of their own ASPECTS for 5 points of ASPECTS
- Players may also trade points of HARMONY.  Every point of HARMONY buys 2 points of ASPECTS
- Players may also go into Debt for up to 2 points of ASPECTS.  This could cover anything from cash debt to service or loyalty.
- Debt does count toward the 5 total points, so only three more points can be traded after a debt is accepted.

KNACKS:
- Knacks are gained automatically when a skill reaches "Expert" or "Master" (2nd or 3rd) rank.
- Only one Knack is chosen per appropriate level.
- Occult Knacks are also known as "Spells."
- Occult Knacks are the arcane magic of the game compared to the innate abilities and special powers covered by ASPECTS

EQUIPMENT:
- Starting Equipment is handled loosely according to the GM
- Gear prices will be listed for GMs who wish to make players pay for Starting Equipment
- Anything else the players wish to purchase during game should deducted from their current cash on hand
- Assume a character has starting cash equal to their Resources or whatever makes most sense.
