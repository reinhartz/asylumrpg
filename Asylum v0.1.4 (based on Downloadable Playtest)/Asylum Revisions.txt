A Cast recommendation is Phil, Grom, Wilhemena, Bradley, Tiffany

B Cast would be Phil, Simon, Annie, Cassandra and Slym?

New MOdel:

Aspect now = Passive ability, keywords

Power now = active ability, keywords

Aspects and Powers have 5 keywords.
1 is an Attribute
2 are skill names
2 are other

If ANY Keywords match, you can sub in a keyworded skill for the genric Power Modifier
If 2 or more Keywords match, you can sub in a keyworded Attribute for the generic Base Impact
Any matching Keyword provides +1 to that Power's Base Impact.
If 2 or more Keywords could be applied to a given roll, you can gain a Minor Advantage


OG Model:
Passives melded into Aspects
Otherwise, exactly like Beta Test model


Revised Model:
OG Aspects are consolidated, Powers merged into a single pool under the consolidated Aspect
Aspects have preferred Skills rather than Powers


GENERAL REVISION:
Skills are 1/2 attribute + Prof + Aspect
Skills and Powers are only gained through Cash/Talents
On Milestone, PC Gains new Aspect or increases Attribute by 1
On Milestone, PC can reorder or replace Foundation
On Milestone, Human (pure) PC can replace a Foundation that's been sold off.

d.	“cross-cut” init system: Roll init, first player does a thing, who/whatever they targeted goes next, if no target you select the next person who goes.  Can use one or both on their turn.  Targeting always defaults to Complex action
